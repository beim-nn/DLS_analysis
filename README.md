# DLS_analysis
This script takes a csv file exported from a WYATT DLS plate reader 
as input and exctracts the radius and polydispersity of the overall 
data set as well as range1. The output is an excel sheet named 
'output.xlsx' which will be stored in a directory named 'results'.
The output will also be rearranged to sort each value of each well by
the set temperature of the measurement.
